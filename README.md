# web_server_borealis
This is the repo for the altered files to run backends.sh and websockets.sh on the Borealis Radar at UOL. 

startbackends.sh
startwebsockets.sh

Both of these will start at bootup of the Pc based at UOL. They basically read the real-time data from the radar and convert it to a websocket that can be read by the website to give realtime FOVs of our data.
